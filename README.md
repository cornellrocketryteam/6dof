# 6dof

This project is a 6 degree of freedom (6dof) model for high powered rockets. It is intended for use by the Cornell Rocketry Team. This repo also contains the sigma-point kalman filter used for estimating the system state. 

The model is protoyped using the Julia language and will be transfered over to C++ for eventual use as the dynamics model in a real-time state estimator.
